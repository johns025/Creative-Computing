		<h1>An Interview With Kamil </h1>
</body>
<strong> 	Do you believe in aliens? </strong>
<br> I think they could possibly exist simply because I find it hard to believe that
 humans are the only life form in the galaxy considering how many unexplored planets
 are out there. <br> So I think there probably is some sort of life form out there but I don’t
 necessarily think it conforms to the stereotypical image we have of extraterrestrial beings.
 <br>
 <br>
 <strong> Do you have any personal experiences with aliens? </strong>
 <br> I personally don’t, but so many people have reported being abducted or having interacted with
 aliens and many have gone through <a href= "https://kemilahypnosis.com/abductions-and-encounters/"style="color:red"> hypnosis </a> to try to remember these events and some seem to be very
 believable. <br> I remember this movie I watched as a kid that was based on true events that gathered
 testimonials of people who were abducted by aliens and they shared their stories and that really freaked
 me out. Most of those <br> happened in <a href= "https://www.adn.com/rural-alaska/article/movie-blames-nome-disappearances-aliens/2009/09/02/"style="color:red"> Alaska</a> so for the longest time I was completely terrified of Alaska and
 never considered going there. But I still think that similarly to ghosts, it is hard to believe that they
 exist.
<br>
<br>
<strong> You mentioned you don’t think aliens look like the stereotypic image people portray them as, so what do YOU think they look like? </strong>
<br> I’m not sure. It’s kind of like trying to describe what you would imagine a ghost looking like. But I just don’t
think aliens look like some massive green big-headed figure with freakishly long finger and huge eyes. <br> And who knows, Maybe there are different
 <a href= "http://www.destinationamerica.com/thehauntist/7-lesser-known-alien-species/"style="color:red"> species</a> of aliens that all look different.
